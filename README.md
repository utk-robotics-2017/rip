# RIP

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/utk-robotics-2017/rip/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=KqhG5MRr9F)](https://codecov.io/gh/utk-robotics-2017/rip)

*Version 0.1*

The Robotics Integrated Platform is designed as an all encompassing library for small autonomous robots using a raspberry pi or beaglebone as the primary controller.

## Dependencies
There are two ways to deal with the dependencies of RIP.

1. Use the provided Docker.
2. Install the packages natively on your local machine.

### Docker
See the [Docker Readme](Docker.md).

### Native Install
RIP requires several dependencies -- namely Eigen 3, Suitesparse, G2O, CMake, and GCC/G++ 4.9+. RIP GUIs require QT5.

## How to Contribute
All contributions should be made through our [Git workflow](https://github.com/utk-robotics-2017/rip/wiki/Git-Workflow) and following our [coding standards](https://github.com/utk-robotics-2017/rip/wiki/Coding-Standards).

Once your contributions are ready to be reviewed, please open a pull request to the dev branch. Ideally, mark your PR with the associated issues and the target milestone/version of RIP.

## Quick Start

### Get a terminal
On Linux, you have a terminal.  
On Windows, you'll want to get a terminal, something besides Cmd or PowerShell.  
There are several options, `Bash on Ubuntu on Windows`, `Mingw`, `Msys2`. You'll also need some additional terminal programs, i.e. cmake, g++, lcov, etc.

### This repo requires ssh.
1. [Generate an ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)
2. [Add the ssh key to github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
3. [Test your ssh connection to github](https://help.github.com/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection/)

### Clone the repo using ssh.
1. Click `Clone or download`
2. Clone with ssh. Make sure the box says `Clone with SSH` in the top left corner of the box, if it doesn't, click `Use SSH` in the top right corner to switch.
3. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the address to your clipboard.
4. In your favorite terminal, type in `git clone --recursive `, then paste the address from github, and hit enter.

### Switch to the branch you'll be working on.
If you'll be working on Arduino Gen, you would switch to one of the `arduino_gen` branches. For instance, if you'll be working on Arduino Gen Unit Tests, then you'll switch to `arduino_gen/unit_tests`.

### Setup CMake
1. Make a directory for the output files (i.e. `build` or `bin`), then go into it.
2. Build the project.
    * Linux: `cmake ..`
    * Windows: `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..`

### Make
Type in `make` and you should start building rip, arduino_gen, etc.  
Make can be sped up by passing `-j<N>`, where is `N` is the number of cores on your computer.

### Build Script
Optionally, rather than setting up the CMake build yourself, you may opt to use the included `build-linux.sh` script which will automatically build RIP in `build/` with testing enabled.
